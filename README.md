# 2026-Uncrackable-Challenge

🛡️ Challenge Security Protocol
Add this text below your website or in your "About" section to prove to the internet that this is a real, fair challenge:

PROTOCOL ID: 2026-OTP-SECURE

Mathematical Fairness: The message is encrypted using a One-Time Pad (XOR). It is mathematically proven that no AI or computer can "guess" the key.

Zero-Knowledge Verification: Your guess is hashed locally in your browser. The "Master Key" is never stored on this server, making it impossible for hackers to steal the answer.

Transparent Escalation: The Prize Pool is funded by the Entry Fees. As more users fail, the "Bounty" grows by exactly $100 per attempt.

Guaranteed Payout: All entry fees are held in escrow at karroumiabdo580@gmail.com. Upon a successful match, the full accumulated balance is released to the winner via PayPal.

Integrity: The system uses SHA-256 Fingerprinting. Even a 1-character difference in your guess will result in a failure.
